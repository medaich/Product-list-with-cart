## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - css utility first framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tanstack Query](https://tanstack.com/) - JS library

### What I learned

I've learned some Tailwind utilities to simplify the life styling my components. And also I've created a reusable Modal component using React Compound Component pattern.

### Continued development

I'd like to continue improving my styling capabilities and my React skills building a lot of projects experimenting its powerful ecosystem using React Tanstack (React Query) for remote state, useReducer, context API, Redux and Redux Toolkit for global state, and also React Patterns such as Compound Component, HOC and render prop. After building powerful projects with React Nextjs would be the next station.
